Hi all!

This is my edited version of ShestakUI for WoW, feel free to use it if you like it.

Compared to the original ShestakUI, I just added/changed a bit of things to better fit my personal taste, nothing more than that.

You'll find more details [here](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info21840-ShestakUI_OzEdit.html) and a big thank go out to Shestak for his amazing work and to all his contributors!

All credits and all rights for all AddOns and for all included modules go out only to the authors, whom I thank for their creativity and their work: I have done just a little bit of editing and nothing more.
